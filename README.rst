DO NOT USE
==========

Please do not use this software. This repository is kept for historical
purposes, since some people have used it in the past. It was created from a
simple find and replace on the `bitcoin-python` repository in mid-2013 and has
never really been maintained.

At this point, I am sure there is a mainstream litecoin/python integration
floating around out there. Please figure out what that is, and use it instead.

Once again, **no one should be using this library**. Please stop and find
something else.

litecoin-python is a set of Python libraries that allows easy access to the
litecoin peer-to-peer cryptocurrency client API.
